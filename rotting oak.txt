[A]
One Billion years ago they oozed upon the Earth,
a new type of life force to behold.
Their Kingdom broke away from their Eukaryotic kin, (YOU-carry-oh-tic)
so foreign were their ways, mistaken for primordial sin

[B]
The Yellow Priest of Old, sat watching this oozing mould
deciding it was time to intervene.

[C]
Six-hundred Million years (pause) ago, they rose above the dirt,
once again seeking more for their kind.
The Yellow Priest decided then, to cast its lot for within
a spark of chaos could seed their mind.

[A]
As an ancient collective consciousness, spread to every cell, 
thus a gravemind began to take shape.
Ancient networks turning on, to deliver a new found song,
sung not by Rooted Folk or Boreal Ape.

[B]
A commanding agent, from otherwordly planes,
Azathoth's delegate to drive them all insane...

[C]
An undead choir, singing with just one mind in unison,
speaking from their mycellium tongue.
Timless directives issue forth along their spongy massive force
to spread a message of what's to be done.

[D]
Seek out the Oaken Folk who's tethered to the Earth,
Their colossal forms blot out the sky. 
Bore their bulks and fill their cores, spill sap from oozing sores.
Their ancient husks shall litter the forest floor when they die.

[E]
When the moon is out, and the phos-phorescence grows,
the old mould of the ancients comes to seek the living souls.
The time is nigh..., to create the living dead.
To raise the spore-born army, as the Crawling Chaos had once said: 




[stuff to use]
Once in an age, long ago, when we/they rose above the earth
to survey the pristine realms...  for our/the Chaos father.
Our/Their ancient collective consciousness spread to every realm,
and that's when we/they encountered the Upright Others. 

The deeply rooted Oaken Folk were tethered to the Earth.
Colossal forms who blotted out the sky.
The selfish Boreal Apes that walked lithely upon two feet
mindlessly trampled those beneath them leaving them to die.

(in a screetchy black metal style)


[chorus]
Send forth your tendrils, and find the life force so full and giving.
Creap beneath their roots, command those souls unwilling.
Those before you fell to seed the Old Growth Forest Floor.
Raise up their lifeless husks and do thy master's bidding once more

[chorus]
Our /hands/tendrils/ reach out to find the life force so full and giving.
We creap beneath their living roots to drain those souls unwilling 
Those before you fell and litter the old growth forest's floor
Their lifeless husks nourish us and soon you too will be nothing more

The Oaken Folk //talk about the trees
As the Ents encroached upon our lands we fought back tenaciously...
entering their minds 


The boreal apes had //talk about mankind



// verse talking about Azathoth and Nyarlathotep
We packed our spore-born minds inside the mushroom forms,
waiting for our enemies' to find us.
With the mind-spawn ordinance pointed at the stars we grew beneath their feet
